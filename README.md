# Weather-Dashboard
Module 6 Challenge - Weather Dashboard

In this challenge, I created a Weather Dashboard. 

<ul>When the user searches for a city, then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.</ul>
<ul>When the current weather conditions for that city are viewed, the user is presented with the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.</ul>
<ul>When future weather conditions are viewed, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.</ul>
<ul>When a city in the search history is clicked on, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.</ul>
